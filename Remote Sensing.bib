  abstract = {Object-based image analysis approach for vessel detection on optical and radar images," Abstract. Commercial satellites for Earth observation can integrate conventional positioning and tracking systems for monitoring legal and illegal activities by sea, in order to effectively detect and prevent events threatening human life and environment. This study describes an object-oriented approach to detect vessels combining high-and medium-resolution optical and radar images. Once detected, the algorithm estimates their position, length, and heading and assigns a speed range. Tests are done using WorldView-2, QuickBird, GeoEye-1, Sentinel-2A, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1 data imaged in several test sites including China, Australia, Italy, Hong Kong, and the western Mediterranean Sea. Validation of results with data from the automatic identification system shows that the estimates for length and heading have R 2 ¼ 0.85 and R 2 ¼ 0.92, respectively. Tests for evaluating speed from Sentinel-2 time-lag image displacement show encouraging results, with 70\% of estimates' residuals within AE2 m∕s. Finally, our method is compared to the state-of-the-art search for unidentified maritime object (SUMO), provided by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. Finally, our method is compared to the state-of-the-art SUMO. Tests with Sentinel-1 data show similar results in terms of correct detections. Nevertheless, our method returns a smaller number of false alarms compared to SUMO.},

  abstract = {The predominant rhetoric in smart city debates puts the emphasis on collaboration. Conceptualizing, designing, implementing, validating, and evaluating solutions to urban challenges with all relevant stakeholders around the table are perceived as the optimal modus operandi in these perspectives. But how does this vision relate to current practices in cities? This paper deals with the observed trend toward more multi-stakeholder collaboration and the resulting complex value networks these stakeholders need to navigate. This is exemplified in what has been called the “platformization” of the urban space by “urban service platforms” (e.g., Uber, AirBnB) as well as in so-called “quadruple helix” approaches to urban innovation. Particularly for (local) government, finding a role in these complex networks has proven challenging. This paper explores the main challenges concerning multi-stakeholder innovation and opportunities related to this topic.},

  abstract = {Place-based structural inequalities can have critical implications for the health of vulnerable populations. Historical urban policies, such as redlining, have contributed to current inequalities in exposure to intra-urban heat. However, it is unknown whether these spatial inequalities are associated with disparities in heat-related health outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine the relationships between historical redlining, intra-urban heat conditions, and heat-related emergency department visits using data from 11 Texas cities. At the zip code level, the proportion of historical redlining was determined, and heat exposure was measured using daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST). Heat-related inpatient and outpatient rates were calculated based on emergency department visit data that included ten categories of heat-related diseases between 2016 and 2019. Regression or spatial error/lag models revealed significant associations between higher proportions of redlined areas in the neighborhood and higher LST (Coef.?=?0.0122, 95\% CI?=?0.0039?0.0205). After adjusting for indicators of social vulnerability, neighborhoods with higher proportions of redlining showed significantly elevated heat-related outpatient visit rate (Coef.?=?0.0036, 95\% CI?=?0.0007?0.0066) and inpatient admission rate (Coef.?=?0.0018, 95\% CI?=?0.0001?0.0035). These results highlight the role of historical discriminatory policies on the disparities of heat-related illness and suggest a need for equity-based urban heat planning and management strategies.},

  abstract = {Intra-urban assessment of air pollution exposure has become a priority study while international attention was attracted to PM2.5 pollution in China in recent years. Land Use Regression (LUR), which has previously been proved to be a feasible way to describe the relationship between land use and air pollution level in European and American cities, was employed in this paper to explain the correlations and spatial variations in Shanghai, China. PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations at 35–45 monitoring locations were selected as dependent variables, and a total of 44 built environmental factors were extracted as independent variables. Only five factors showed significant explanatory value for both PM2.5 and NO2 models: longitude, distance from monitors to the ocean, highway intensity, waterbody area, and industrial land area for PM2.5 model; residential area, distance to the coast, industrial area, urban district, and highway intensity for NO2 model. Respectively, both PM2.5 and NO2 showed anti-correlation with coastal proximity (an indicator of clean air dilution) and correlation with highway and industrial intensity (source indicators). NO2 also showed significant correlation with local indicators of population density (residential intensity and urban classification), while PM2.5 showed significant correlation with regional dilution (longitude as a indicator of distance from polluted neighbors and local water features). Both adjusted R squared values were strong with PM2.5 (0.88) being higher than NO2 (0.62). The LUR was then used to produce continuous concentration fields for NO2 and PM2.5 to illustrate the features and, potentially, for use by future studies. Comparison to PM2.5 studies in New York and Beijing show that Shanghai PM2.5 pollutant distribution was more sensitive to geographic location and proximity to neighboring regions.},

In this study, we conducted a holistic review of the major advances and challenges in quantifying PM, with a specific focus on instruments, algorithms, datasets, and modeling methods that have been developed over the past 20 years. The aim of this study is to provide a general guide for future satellite-based PM concentration mapping practices and to better support air quality monitoring and management of environmental health. Specifically, we review the evolution of satellite platforms, sensors, inversion algorithms, and datasets that can be used for monitoring aerosol properties. We then compare various practical methods and techniques that have been used to estimate PM mass concentrations and group them into four primary categories: (1) univariate regression, (2) chemical transport models (CTM), (3) multivariate regression, and (4) empirical physical approaches. Considering the main challenges encountered in PM mapping practices, for example, data gaps and discontinuity, a hybrid method is proposed with the aim of generating PM concentration maps that are both spatially continuous and have high precision.},
